# Redesign progress

## Active objective

Complete the whole StepUp application and all its screens/states for GASOK submission and real user testing. Full objective remains active until audited against implementation, build, APK, captures and functional evidence.

## 2026-09-24 — baseline and foundation

- Latest origin/main verified: d066164122a4dc31fbe1b4c88526e4d690f1bbdb.
- Dedicated branch: codex/stepup-cohesive-redesign. Includes two existing screenshot tooling commits, no unrelated user modifications.
- Approved visual direction and product facts are already settled through this conversation; no new direction selection or interview is needed.
- Product/design/agent rules recorded. Eight accepted concepts will be committed as reference only.
- Existing risks: logo calls accept arbitrary sizes; header implementations differ; nav policy uses loosely matched routes; run CTA is below the initial home viewport; screenshots include states, not distinct screens.

## Milestones

| Milestone | State | Evidence / next action |
|---|---|---|
| Full route/state inventory | in progress | Inspect root routes, dialogs, screens and existing capture fixtures |
| Locked shared chrome and guardrails | in progress | Implement tokens, fixed logo variants, route policy, tests |
| Startup → home → run → result/reward → wardrobe | pending | Preserve real initialization, tracking, data and ownership |
| All remaining screens and states | pending | Apply the same system; track every row |
| Native visual/interaction/device validation | pending | Build/CI/emulator, then device-only checks explicitly tracked |
| Final APK, screenshot gallery, change/test report | pending | Must all describe the same candidate revision |

## Environment / unverified dependencies

- Local Android SDK/JDK/adb are not on PATH. Existing GitHub Actions build and emulator capture infrastructure is available.
- No claim yet of real-device GPS/background behavior, signed-in financial flows, GIWA wallet integration, release signing or store readiness.
- No completion or blocking conclusion is justified: substantial local implementation remains available.
