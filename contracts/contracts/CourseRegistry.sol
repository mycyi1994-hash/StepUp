/**
 * @title CourseRegistry
 * @notice Public record of StepUp running courses and who made them.
 *
 * A course in the app is a GPS polyline someone actually ran, saved and
 * published for other runners. Two things about it need to be true in a way a
 * user does not have to take our word for:
 *
 *  1. **Who authored it**, and when. Course creation is the one piece of
 *     user-generated value in StepUp, and a leaderboard of creators is
 *     worthless if the operator can rewrite it.
 *  2. **What it pays.** `rewardFor` is the completion reward, in SUP, as a pure
 *     function of distance — `km x 1.0`, capped at 42 (marathon distance). No
 *     random roll, no operator discretion. A runner can compute their reward
 *     before they start, from public code.
 *
 * The polyline itself stays off chain — a few hundred coordinates per course is
 * not something to pay calldata for. What is stored is `polylineHash`, so the
 * track served by the app can be checked against the one that was registered.
 *
 * Completion counts are written by `recorder` (the attester), because a
 * completion is only meaningful if the same GPS plausibility checks that gate a
 * reward also gate the counter. Authorship is not: anyone may create a course.
